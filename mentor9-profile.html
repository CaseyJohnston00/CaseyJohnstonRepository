                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Harper Lee, and I have over 8 years of experience as a game designer. Throughout my career, I have worked on a wide variety of game genres, including role-playing games, puzzle games, and action-adventure titles. My expertise lies in level design, player experience, and narrative integration.</p>
                <p>I specialize in creating engaging game mechanics and intuitive designs that keep players immersed in the world I've built. I work closely with developers and artists to ensure the design vision is realized in every element of the game, from the environments to the player interactions.</p>
                <p>My goal is to create memorable experiences that challenge players while offering satisfying rewards. Iâ€™m passionate about blending creative storytelling with innovative gameplay, ensuring every project I work on is both fun and meaningful for the player.</p>
