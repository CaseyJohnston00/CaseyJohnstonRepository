                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>My name is Christian Douglas. I have 7+ years of experience in art and animation, specializing in character design, 2D/3D animation, and visual storytelling. Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on various game projects, contributing to the creation of captivating art styles and bringing life to characters and environments through animation.</p>
                    <p>My passion lies in creating visually stunning worlds that enhance the playerâ€™s experience, blending artistic creativity with technical expertise. I enjoy experimenting with new animation techniques and always strive to push the boundaries of what's possible, whether it's creating dynamic character movements or crafting immersive environments.</p>
                    <p>In addition to my work as an artist and animator, I love collaborating with other creatives to bring a unified vision to life. I find great fulfillment in mentoring junior artists and animators, helping them grow and refine their craft in the game development process.</p>
